                  Welcome to our assessment tool designed to determine your eligibility to confirm the basic criteria for relocating to Sweden. We've developed this tool to ensure that you can ascertain your eligibility for your desired Visa or Residence Permit for your relocation. Upon completing the assessment process, you'll receive your result. If the assessment indicates eligibility, you can also download our app and assess your eligibility there as well.

                  </p>
                  <p className=" tw-text-gray tw-pt-2">
                  If the assessment indicates eligibility, simply sign up and book an appointment to discuss further. Even in cases where the result is negative or uncertain, you can still contact us, and we can explore possibilities together.

                  </p>
                  <p className=" tw-text-gray tw-pt-2">

Our team of Migration/Relocation consultants possesses the expertise to advise you on relocation and immigration strategy, ensure the right documentation is provided, and ultimately, increase the likelihood of a successful application.

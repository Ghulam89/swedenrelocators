                    <p className=" tw-text-gray">
                    At the time  of applying for family reunification you must have a valid residence permit for the country which means, if your residence permit has expired and you have applied for its extension, then the Swedish Migration Agency will first decide that whether you have the right to continue the residence permit or not. It isnâ€™t enough for you to have the title of a temporary resident or having a previous valid residence permit.


                    </p>
                    <p className=" tw-text-gray">
                    Only you immediate family(your spouse, registered partner or cohabiting partner, and your children under the age of 18) can move to you if you have a temporary work permit. Only in exceptional cases it is possible to get a residence permit for other family members.


                    </p>

                    <p className=" tw-text-gray">
One must fulfill maintainance requirement in order to apply for family reunification which means one should be able to financially support his/her family and also have a home of sufficient size and standard.
